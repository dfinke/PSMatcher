# PSMatcher
PSMatcher is a test utility, that lets you easier test responses and json, when some part of the response is something out of your control (autogenerated id, guid, datetime etc).

It's here on the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSMatcher)

# Overview
This PowerShell has been tested on Windows in both v5.1 and v6.0

```powershell
Import-Module ..\PSMatcher.psm1 -Force

$actual = @"
{
    "id" : "5a645a20-5225-431b-8c62-031b87f58b73",
    "subnode" : {
        "city" : "NY",
        "zipCode" : "80-000",
        "meta" : {
            "name" : "foobar",
            "shipping": 99.99,
            "enabled" : false,
            "_link" : "http://example.com?page=2",
            "_something" : null,
            "_arr" : [1, 2, 3],
            "_date" : "2018-01-01"
        }
    }
}
"@

$expected = @"
{
    "id" : "@guid@",
    "subnode" : {
        "city" : "NY",
        "zipCode" : "@string@",
        "meta" : {
            "name" : "@string@.Contains('bar')",
            "shipping": "@double@",
            "enabled" : "@bool@",
            "_link" : "@any@",
            "_something" : "@null@",
            "_arr" : [1, 2, 3],
            "_date" : "@string@.IsDateTime()"
        }
    }
}
"@

Test-Json $actual $expected
```
# Results
```
Successful ErrorMessage
---------- ------------
      True
```

# In addition
The matcher also checks if elements are missing or if too many are supplied.

**Stay Tuned**: Examples will be added showing how well this works with PowerShell objects and Hashtables.

# Available Expressions

* @string@
* @int@
* @double@
* @bool@
* @null@
* @any@
* @guid@
